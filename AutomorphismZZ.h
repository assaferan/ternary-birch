// This class defines a number of integral automorphisms with determinant +1
//  for convenient reference throughout various other classes and objects.
//  The goal being that we wish to avoid consuming too much memory if we need
//  to access automorphisms across various forms with the same automorphism
//  matrices.
//
// The naming convention is row major, so that we have:
//
//  Aabcdefghi = | a  b  c |
//               | d  e  f |
//               | g  h  i |
//
//  where 1 -->  1
//        0 -->  0
//        N --> -1
